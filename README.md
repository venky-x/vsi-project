Visual-Spoken Interface using Python 🎙️👁️🧠


This project implements an intelligent multimodal interface combining visual recognition and gesture-based interaction using Python. The system is designed to enhance human-computer interaction by recognizing users and interpreting their gestures and emotions in real time.

🔍 Key Features:


🧑‍💻 Face Recognition: Identifies and authenticates users using facial features.

✋ Gesture Recognition: Detects common hand gestures such as:

👍 Thumbs Up

👋 Hello/Wave

🛑 Other custom gestures

😊 Emotion Recognition: Analyzes facial expressions to determine the user's emotional state (e.g., happy, sad, surprised).

🎨 Interactive UI: Designed with a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction.

🛠️ Technologies Used:


Python (OpenCV, Mediapipe, face_recognition, deep learning models)

Real-time webcam input

Visual overlay and feedback for detected events

This project explores human-centric interaction where visual cues replace or complement voice input, making it suitable for accessibility tools, intelligent kiosks, or robotic interfaces.
